## Setup

Ensure that Python is installed in your system. In the project directory, open the terminal and execute:

```
python -m venv env
```

to create a Python virtual environment. Then you can activate the virtual environment by running

```
.\env\Script\activate
```

in Windows. For Linux machines, you can run

```
source ./env/bin/activate
```

Now that the virtual environment is activated, you can start installing the libraries by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Setup is then done! You can execute the notebooks using the virtual environment as the Python kernel.
